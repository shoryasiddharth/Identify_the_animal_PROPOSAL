# Identify_the_animal_PROPOSAL
Wildlife images captured in a field represent a challenging task while classifying animals since they appear with a different pose, cluttered background, different light and climate conditions, different viewpoints, and occlusions. Additionally, animals of different classes look similar. All these challenges necessitate an efficient algorithm for classification.
I have a proposal towards my MLND capstone project regarding the same I'll train a CNN with multiple layers.
More details are in the Proposal.pdf file.

I could not attach the dataset as it is 6+ GBs in size and thus here is the source from where you can get it-

Going to this link will automatically start downloading the data set.
This is a hackathon on hackerearth.com and it's link is as follows-
